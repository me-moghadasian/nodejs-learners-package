## Installation

To get started with this package, follow these steps:

1. **Install Node.js**:
   - Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed. This is required for running JavaScript on the server side and for certain functionalities in this package.

2. **Install the Node.js Jupyter Kernel**:
   - You need the [IJavascript kernel](https://github.com/n-riesco/ijavascript) for Jupyter to run JavaScript code. You can install it using the following commands:
     ```bash
     npm install -g ijavascript
     ijsinstall
     ```

3. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/me-moghadasian/nodejs-learners-package.git
    ```

4. **Navigate into the Project Directory**:
    ```bash
    cd nodejs-learners-package
    ```

5. **Install Project Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

6. **Install JupyterLab** (if not already installed):
   - If you don't have JupyterLab installed, you'll need Python and JupyterLab. You can install JupyterLab using:
    ```bash
    pip install jupyterlab
    ```

7. **Start JupyterLab**:
    ```bash
    jupyter lab
    ```
