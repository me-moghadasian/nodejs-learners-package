# Node.js Learners Package

## Description

This package offers a concise introduction to Node.js (using JupyterLab), focusing only on the essential concepts and skills. It covers the fundamental topics necessary for understanding and practicing (or reviewing) Node.js, including:

- Declaring Variables and Working with Functions
- Loops and Branching
- JSON Handling
- Collections (Arrays, Maps, and Sets)
- Working with Files
- Async-await, Promise and Events
- HTTP Connections
- MongoDB and Mongoose
- Express Framework

## Active Development

Please note that this package is actively being modified and updated. We are continuously working to improve and expand the content based on feedback and new developments in Node.js. New features, topics, and enhancements will be added over time. To ensure you have the latest dependencies and updates, you might need to run `npm install` periodically.

## Features

- **Variables and Functions**: Learn how to create and use variables and functions in Node.js.
- **Loops and Branching**: Understand different looping constructs and conditional statements.
- **JSON**: Work with JSON data, including parsing and stringifying JSON.
- **Collections**: Explore arrays, maps, and sets, and how to manipulate them.
- **File Handling**: Read from and write to files using Node.js.
- **Async-await, Promise and Events**: Learn how to do asynchronous operations with async-await, promise and events.
- **HTTP Connections**: Create basic HTTP servers and handle requests and responses.
- **MongoDB and Mongoose**: Connect to a MongoDB database and perform CRUD operations using Mongoose.
- **Express**: Build web applications using the Express framework.

## Installation

To get started with this package, follow these steps:

1. **Install Node.js**:
   - Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed. This is required for running Node.js apps in this package.

2. **Install the Node.js Jupyter Kernel**:
   - You need the [IJavascript kernel](https://github.com/n-riesco/ijavascript) for Jupyter to run JavaScript code. You can install it using the following commands:
     ```bash
     npm install -g ijavascript
     ijsinstall
     ```

3. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/me-moghadasian/nodejs-learners-package.git
    ```

4. **Navigate into the Project Directory**:
    ```bash
    cd nodejs-learners-package
    ```

5. **Install Project Dependencies**:
    - Install MongoDB too when you want to try MongoDB related sections.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

7. **Install JupyterLab** (if not already installed):
   - If you don't have JupyterLab installed, you'll need Python and JupyterLab. You can install JupyterLab using:
    ```bash
    pip install jupyterlab
    ```

8. **Start JupyterLab**:
    ```bash
    jupyter lab
    ```

9. **Open and Explore the Notebooks and Scripts**:
   - Use JupyterLab to open and explore the notebooks and scripts provided in the package.
